# Store-bot

# This is an example of a Telegram shop-bot. It's a simple yet effective way to place an order without leaving your favorite messenger. 

## What can it do?

# 1. `/start` - needed to start the bot, as well as to choose the mode (user / admin). 
# 2. `/menu` - go to the menu. 
# 3. `/sos` - ask a question to the administrator.

## Menu

# The user menu looks like this:

## Catalog

# The catalog consists of products, sorted by categories. The user has the ability to add items to the cart, and the admin has full rights to edit the catalog (add / delete).

## Basket

# The ordering process is as follows: the user goes to `🛍️ Catalog`, moves to the desired category, selects products and presses the `🛒 Basket` button.
